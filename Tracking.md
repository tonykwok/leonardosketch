# Leonardo Tracking #

Leonardo does basic tracking and reports back to a Google Analytics account. This tracking is **completely anonymous** and is never used for anything other than tracking usage of Leonardo and helping us to improve it. Leonardo will ask you if you want to allow anonymous tracking when you run it for the first time. If you say no then it will never track you. You can change this setting at any time in the preferences.

# What Information does Leonardo Track? #

Leonardo tracks when you launch the application and when you close it. That's it for now. In the future we will track usage of different tools to determine if they are effective. We also plan to track errors and exceptions.  When we enable further tracking you will be notified and we'll explain what's new. You always have the ability to opt out of any tracking.

# What do you do with the information? #

We just track how many people are using Leonardo and use the info to help improve it. Leonardo is a fully open source project and we have no desire to sell your data or send you advertising.
